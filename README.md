Hello World! 

I am a Financial Analyst with 2 years of experience across the realms of data science, analytics, finance, and healthcare. I have had the privilege of collaborating with esteemed organizations such as Goldman Sachs, Accurate Labs, and Airscout. 

Educationally, I obtained my Master of Science in Business Analytics from University of Illinois Urbana - Champaign, with a focus on Data Analytics in Finance. My academic journey was highlighted with an Academic Excellence Award and a perfect GPA. Prior to my Masterâ€™s, I completed my Bachelor of Science in Business Administration with a specialization in Finance from the University at Buffalo, SUNY. 

My professional engagements include a pivotal role as a Financial Analyst in the Apple card fraud and analytics team at Goldman Sachs, liaising with a diverse clientele and stakeholders throughout the US. Additionally, my role at Accurate Labs involved delving into the healthcare domain to analyze markets. I also undertook an internship at Airscout, where I steered financial endeavors in tandem with agricultural software development. 

My technical proficiency encompasses data extraction, database querying, data mining, exploratory data analysis, visualization, and ML modeling. I am adept at using tools such as Python, SQL, R, SAS, Power BI, and Tableau. My expertise further extends to ETL processes and visualization platforms like Knime, Power BI, and Tableau. Additionally, I have hands-on experience with cloud and data lake infrastructures, specifically AWS, Mongo DB and Salesforce. My comprehensive skill set also covers data cleaning, manipulation, analysis, and predictive modeling. I have effectively harnessed my data storytelling capabilities to decipher vast datasets, delivering actionable insights to both technical and non-technical audiences. Driven by an unwavering passion for data and analytics, I am eager to leverage my robust analytical and communication skills in roles such as Data Analyst, Business Analyst, Financial Analyst, and Data Scientist. I am keen on contributing to consulting, product-based, financial, and tech firms.
